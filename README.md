##About the Author##

I'm [Chorizorro](http://account.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/stats.aspx?player=Chorizorro "Chorizorro's player profile"), I've been playing Smite casually for 7 months.

I'm also the creator of [Smitroll](http://smitroll.com "Visit Smitroll"), a site that simply generates random builds (random god, random skills, random items and abilities), to play fun games.
The SmiteAPIHelper is a module I developed for Smitroll, and that I modified to make it a bit more generic and usable by any developer creating a PHP site using access to the Smite API.
